### Requirements
This model is built to work with specific parts from the **Arduino Starter Kit for beginner**, it is however possible to resize the parts to fit bigger or smaller parts.
- 9v battery
- Small D/C Motor (6v/9v)
- Mini Push button Switch
- 9V battery snap
- Attachable disk for the motor with a hole to add the motor holder to
- glue
- Toothbrush

### .blend to .STL conversion
In Blender you will first need the add-on to be able to export the objects in .stl format: **Edit -> Add-ons -> Mesh: 3D-print Toolbox**. Next highlight the parts that you will be printing (parts that aren't connected to each other already should be printed separately), then click on **3DPrint** on the left side under **View** and press the **Export** button.
